title: "Agent"
---
An agent in computing and artificial intelligence refers to an autonomous system or program that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and act toward achieving specific goals.

In AI, agents process input (such as data, user queries, or environmental signals), apply reasoning or learning, and then perform actions, often in iterative cycles. They can be as simple as a script that automates tasks or as advanced as AI-powered assistants capable of adapting to changing conditions.

**Example**

* A chatbot that interprets customer questions and responds automatically.
* An AI coding assistant that analyzes code, suggests improvements, and can run commands.

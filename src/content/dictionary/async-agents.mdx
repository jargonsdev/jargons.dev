title: "Async Agents"
---
Async agents (short for **asynchronous agents**) are software agents that operate independently and handle tasks without waiting for other processes to finish.

They are designed to perform actions concurrently, often by leveraging asynchronous programming techniques. This allows them to manage multiple tasks or requests in parallel, improving efficiency and responsiveness in distributed systems, AI workflows, or event-driven architectures.

**Example**

* An async agent in a chatbot system processes one userâ€™s request while simultaneously fetching external data for another, without blocking either task.

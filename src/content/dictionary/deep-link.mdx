A deep link is a URI (URL) that encodes a destination inside an app or site—identifying a specific piece of content or a specific state (e.g., a product detail view, a prefilled checkout, a tab + filter)—so the user can land there directly from an external source instead of starting at the homepage.

In mobile, deep links typically use either a custom scheme (myshopapp://...) or a web URL that can open the app (“universal/app links”), with a fallback to the website/app store if the app isn’t installed.

**Examples:**
- Link in an email: `https://shop.example.com/products/12345?ref=newsletter`
- If the app is installed, tapping it opens the app to Product 12345 (optionally showing the “newsletter” promo/referrer).
- If the app isn’t installed, it opens the same product page on the web (or can route to the app store).

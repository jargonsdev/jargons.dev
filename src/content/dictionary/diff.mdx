Diff (short for **difference**) is a term used in computing to describe the comparison between two versions of a file, set of files, or data, highlighting the changes made.

It is commonly used in version control systems like Git to show what has been added, modified, or removed between revisions. Diffs help developers quickly understand changes in codebases, making collaboration and code review more efficient.

**Example**

```diff
- const name = "John";
+ const name = "Jane";
```

This diff shows that the value of the variable `name` was changed from *John* to *Jane*.

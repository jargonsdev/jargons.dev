---
Developer Experience (DX) refers to how developers feel when using a tool, framework, API, library, or platform—essentially, it’s the user experience (UX) for developers. It measures how easy, efficient, and enjoyable it is for developers to get their work done.

**Key aspects of DX:**
- **Ease of use** – How simple is it to set up and start using?
- **Documentation** – Is it clear and helpful?
- **Tooling** – Are the tools reliable and developer-friendly?
- **Error handling** – Are error messages understandable?
- **Support** – Are there guides, examples, and community help?

GenAI (short for **Generative Artificial Intelligence**) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content such as text, images, code, audio, or video by learning patterns from existing data.

Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed mainly for classification or prediction, GenAI models generate original outputs that mimic human creativity. These systems are widely used in applications like chatbots, content creation, design, and software development.

**Example**

* A GenAI model generates realistic images from text prompts.
* A language model writes human-like responses to user queries.

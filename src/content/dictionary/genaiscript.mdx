GenAIScript (short for **Generative AI Script**) is a framework or scripting layer designed to define, test, and automate interactions with generative AI models.

It provides developers with a structured way to write prompts, manage context, and integrate AI workflows into development processes or CI/CD pipelines. By treating AI interactions as scripts, GenAIScript helps ensure repeatability, version control, and collaboration, making it easier to build reliable AI-powered tools and applications.

**Example**

* A developer writes a GenAIScript to automatically review code changes using an AI model before merging a pull request.

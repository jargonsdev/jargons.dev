A glob (short for **global**) is a pattern-matching syntax used to identify sets of filenames or paths with the help of wildcard characters such as `*` and `?`.

It provides a simplified way to match multiple files without listing them individually, making it common in command-line operations, scripting, and configuration files. Unlike regular expressions, globs are limited in scope but easier to use for file-matching tasks.

**Example**

* `*.js` matches all JavaScript files in the current directory.
* `images/*.png` matches all PNG images inside the *images* folder.

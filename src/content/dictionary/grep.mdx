Grep (short for **Global Regular Expression Print**) is a command-line utility used to search for specific patterns of text within files.

It scans through input data and prints the lines that match the given pattern, making it a powerful tool for text processing and analysis. Widely used in Unix and Linux systems, `grep` supports regular expressions, enabling flexible and advanced search capabilities.

**Example**

* `grep "error" logfile.txt` finds and prints all lines containing the word *error* in *logfile.txt*.

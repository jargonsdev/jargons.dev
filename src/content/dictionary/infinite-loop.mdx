title: "Infinite Loop"
---
An infinite loop is a loop in programming that **never stops running** because the ending condition is never met (or missing).

**Key idea**:

- Normally, loops run until a condition becomes false.
- In an infinite loop, that condition always stays true (or thereâ€™s no way to exit).

**Example (JavaScript):**

```js
while (true) {
  console.log("This will run forever!");
}
```

This loop will keep printing endlessly until the program is stopped.

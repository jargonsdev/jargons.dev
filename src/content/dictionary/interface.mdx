An interface is a defined boundary or contract that specifies how different software components or systems communicate with each other. It outlines a set of methods, properties, or behaviors that a class or module must implement without dictating how these are executed internally.

In programming, interfaces enable abstraction and help separate the "what" from the "how." They allow developers to write flexible and reusable code by ensuring different parts of a program can interact through a common set of rules, regardless of their internal implementation.

Example: In Java, an interface might declare methods that a class must implement:

```java
public interface Vehicle { 
    void start();
    void stop();
}
```

Any class implementing Vehicle must provide its own versions of start() and stop().

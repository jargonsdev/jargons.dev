---
MCP (short for Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that enables (external) applications, services, and developer tools to connect with AI models in a structured and consistent way.

It provides a framework where AI systems can access external data, tools, or services through well-defined interfaces, making integrations more reliable and interoperable. By standardizing how models communicate with their environment, MCP helps developers build scalable and extensible AI-powered applications.

A model in computing and artificial intelligence refers to a mathematical or computational representation of a system, concept, or process, trained to perform specific tasks such as prediction, classification, or generation.

In machine learning and AI, a model is built by training algorithms on data, allowing it to recognize patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. Models vary in complexity, from simple linear regressions to large-scale neural networks that power modern AI applications.

**Example**

* A spam detection model classifies whether an email is spam or not.
* A language model generates human-like text based on user input.

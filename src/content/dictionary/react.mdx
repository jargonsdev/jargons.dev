React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially web applications. It helps developers build apps by breaking the UI into **components**—small, reusable pieces of code (like buttons, forms, or entire sections of a page).

**Key Ideas**:
- **Component-based** - build UI in pieces and reuse them.
- **Virtual DOM** - React updates only the parts of the page that change, making apps faster.
- **Declarative** - you describe what the UI should look like, and React handles how to update it.

**Example**:
```jsx
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}
```

This simple React component shows “Hello, world!” on a webpage.

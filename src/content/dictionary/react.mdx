React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs), especially for web applications.

Here are the key points about React:
	â€¢	Developed by: Facebook (now Meta).
	â€¢	Component-based: Applications are built using small, reusable pieces of UI called components.
	â€¢	Declarative: You describe what the UI should look like, and React takes care of updating it when data changes.
	â€¢	Virtual DOM: React uses an in-memory representation of the DOM (Document Object Model) called the Virtual DOM. This makes updates faster, since React only changes whatâ€™s necessary on the real page.
	â€¢	Unidirectional data flow: Data flows in one direction (from parent to child components), making applications easier to debug and maintain.
	â€¢	Ecosystem: React has a huge ecosystem, with tools like React Router (for navigation), Redux/Zustand/Recoil (for state management), and Next.js (for server-side rendering and full-stack apps).

ðŸ‘‰ In simple terms: React helps developers build fast, interactive, and scalable web apps by breaking UIs into components that can update efficiently when data changes

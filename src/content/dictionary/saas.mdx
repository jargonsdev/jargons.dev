SaaS (**Software as a Service**) is a cloud-based software delivery model where applications are hosted and maintained by a provider and made available to users over the internet.
Instead of installing or updating software locally, users access it through a web browser, reducing setup time and maintenance costs.

### How It Works
- The service provider hosts and manages the software and underlying infrastructure.
- Updates, backups, and security are handled automatically by the provider.
- Users subscribe to the service on a **pay-as-you-go** or **subscription** basis.

### Examples
- **Google Workspace**: Cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools.
- **Salesforce**: Customer relationship management (CRM) platform.
- **Slack**: Team communication and collaboration platform.
- **Dropbox**: Cloud storage and file-sharing service.

### Example Code
Accessing a SaaS API with JavaScript:

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example-saas.com/data", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

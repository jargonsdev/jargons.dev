Spec Driven Development (SDD) is a software development approach where detailed specifications or requirements are created before writing the actual code. These specifications guide the design, implementation, and testing of the software to ensure it meets the desired functionality.

This method emphasizes clear, upfront documentation of what the software should do, helping teams align on expectations and reduce misunderstandings. It often involves writing formal or semi-formal documents that describe features, user interactions, and system behavior in detail.


**Example:** In Spec Driven Development, a team might write a specification stating, "The login feature must allow users to enter a username and password, validate credentials, and redirect to the dashboard upon success," before any coding begins.

title: "Software Requirements Specification (SRS)"
---
A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a detailed document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system, as well as its intended behavior, interfaces, and constraints. It serves as a reference for both developers and stakeholders, ensuring that all parties understand the software's goals and design.

The SRS provides a comprehensive description of the software's functionality, including the system's features, user interactions, and any technical or operational requirements.

A tuple is a data structure that is an immutable, or unchangeable, ordered sequence of elements. Because tuples are immutable, their values cannot be modified.

Generally, tuples use less memory than a list or array. It allows for slicing and indexing like lists but do not have methods for deleting or changing elements.

#### Key Characteristics of Tuples:

- **Immutable**: You cannot modify, add, or remove items after creating the tuple.
- **Ordered**: Items in a tuple maintain their defined order.
- **Can Store Different Data Types**: Each element in a tuple can be of any data type.
- **Supports Indexing**: Access elements using indices starting from 0.

**Example (Python):**

```python
# creating a tuple 
mySiblings = ('Susan', 'James', 'Bryan')

# accessing an element within a tuple:

mySiblings[2]

```

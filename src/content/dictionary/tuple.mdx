A tuple is a data structure that is an immutable, or unchangeable, ordered sequence of elements. Because tuples are immutable, their values cannot be modified.

As a general rule, tuples use less memory than a list or array.

Tuples allows for slicing and indexing like lists, but do not have methods for deleting or changing any elements.

## Example

```python
# creating a tuple 
mySiblings = ('Susan', 'James', 'Bryan')

# accessing an element within a tuple:

mySiblings[2]
```
